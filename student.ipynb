The reason why I won't bin them further is that in March 2011, the two brands do not always have directly competing products. Google Play Music didn't launch until November 2011. Chromebooks did not exist yet. In 2023, there are only two Google Retail stores. Likewise, Apple Maps didn't release until 2012. As far as I know, Apple has never publicly considered launching a social network or blogging site.\n",

    "I will classify the tweets about the Apple store as part of the Apple Brand, since a store is not a product itself. A store is the physical space used to sell products, and the final bit of marketing to get people to buy once they have arrived with that purpose in mind. So since a store and a brand are both part of marketing, I'll label tweets about stores as part of the brand. However, if a tweet mentions both the store and any other apple product, I'll label it as a tweet about products.\n",

    "Lastly, I thought about classifying all Google Circles tweets as brand since, in March 2011, Google Circles was mere speculation for it's upcoming social network, that eventually was confirmed to be Google Plus. I decided to leave this category as Google Products because people's speculation about the product reflects what they think of current Google products. "
